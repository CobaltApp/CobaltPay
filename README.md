## üöÄ Getting Started

Firstly, decide if you want to host an instance yourself or use a [third-party host](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/ThirdPartyHosting/). If you've chosen to self-host, there are plenty of documented [ways to deploy Cobalt Pay](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Deployment/).

After successful deployment, make sure to check our [getting started](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/RegisterAccount/) and [walkthrough](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Walkthrough/) guides. In case you would like to use Lightning Network, see [Lightning guide](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/LightningNetwork/).

### How to build

While the documentation advises using docker-compose, you may want to build Cobalt Pay yourself.

First, install .NET Core SDK v6.0 as specified by the [Microsoft website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0).

On Powershell:

```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

On linux:

```sh
./build.sh
```

### How to run

Use the `run` scripts to run Cobalt Pay, this example shows how to print the available command-line arguments of Cobalt Pay.

On Powershell:

```powershell
.\run.ps1 --help
```

On linux:

```sh
./run.sh --help
```

### How to debug

If you want to debug, use Jetbrain's Rider or Visual Studio 2022.

You need to run the development time docker-compose as described [in the test guide](./BTCPayServer.Tests/README.md).

You can then run the debugger by using the Launch Profile `Docker-Regtest`.

If you need to debug ledger wallet interaction, install the development time certificate with:

```bash
# Install development time certificate in the trust store
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Then use the `Docker-Regtest-https` debug profile.
